I found this article interesting because it brought up the idea that despite AI being able to now generate code, it might not lead to quality code and therefore could create technical debt and code that is hard to maintain. This could contrast people's initial thoughts about AI code generators in that it would lead to more productivity and efficiency. It seems that depending on the context, it could actually be a detriment to extremely complex projects or projects that need to be continuously maintained. The article notes that AI written code can lead to more mistakes and be harder to maintain. It seems that AI code generators should definitely be used with caution and awareness for these potential mistakes.


### Janet's Comment
This is a really interesting article! Especially now, when the use of ChatGPT in coding is so prevalent, it's really interesting to see the criticisms involved. A lot of the people I've spoken to say that ChatGPT's generated code contains a very distinct 'look' to it, especially in the sense that the logic in which it's coded with tends to not make sense. Like the Harding says, "hastily added code is caustic to the teams expected to maintain it afterward," and I think that's heavily because AI doesn't rely on readable logic at times, but instead the "code churn" of a quick solution.
